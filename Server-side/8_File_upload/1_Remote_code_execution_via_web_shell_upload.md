Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
