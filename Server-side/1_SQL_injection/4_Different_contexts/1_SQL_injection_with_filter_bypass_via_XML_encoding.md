# Lab: SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in its stock check feature. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a `users` table, which contains the usernames and passwords of registered users. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack to retrieve the admin user's credentials, then log in to their account. 

`Hint`: A web application firewall (WAF) will block requests that contain obvious signs of a SQL injection attack. You'll need to find a way to obfuscate your malicious query to bypass this filter. We recommend using the Hackvertor extension to do this.
