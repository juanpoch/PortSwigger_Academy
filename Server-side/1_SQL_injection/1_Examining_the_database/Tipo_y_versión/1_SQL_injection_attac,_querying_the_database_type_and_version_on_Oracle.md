# Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string.

`Hint`: On Oracle databases, every `SELECT` statement must specify a table to select `FROM`. If your `UNION SELECT` attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the `FROM` keyword followed by a valid table name.

There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which you can use for this purpose. For example: `UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual `
