# Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes a `Welcome back` message in the page if the query returns any rows.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the `administrator` user.

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user. 

`Hint`: You can assume that the password only contains lowercase, alphanumeric characters.
