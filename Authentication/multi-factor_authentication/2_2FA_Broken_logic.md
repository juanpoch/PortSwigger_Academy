# Lab: 2FA broken logic

This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`
You also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code.

Hint: Carlos will not attempt to log in to the website himself.
