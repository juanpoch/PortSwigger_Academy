# Lab: Password brute-force via password change

 This lab's password change functionality makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. To solve the lab, use the list of candidate passwords to brute-force Carlos's account and access his "My account" page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`
- Wordlist: `Candidate passwords`

# Password Manipulation and Brute-Force Attack Flow:

---

### Logging in reveals a panel for changing the password. We attempt to change it using the correct current password to observe the server's response:

---

### Next, we try again but with an incorrect current password:

---

### After logging in again with the correct password, the server informs us that we have made too many failed attempts:

---

### This confirms that attempting to change the password with an incorrect `current password` logs us out and blocks us for 1 minute.

---

### Given that the `username` parameter is under our control and the server's responses differ based on whether the entered password is correct, we attempt a brute-force attack on the password for `carlos`.

### As expected, this yields no significant results:

### Letâ€™s reanalyze the password reset functionality.

---

### Entering the correct `current password` and two new passwords that do not match:

### Entering the incorrect `current password` and two new passwords that do not match:

---

### The server responds with `Current password is incorrect`. This shows that the error handling allows us to perform a brute-force attack using **Burp Suite Intruder**.

---

### Configure the payload and execute a **Sniper Attack**:

### The attack reveals the password:

### Log in to Carlos's account and access his "My Account" page:
