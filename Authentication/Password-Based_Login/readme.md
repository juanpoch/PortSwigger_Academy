# Vulnerabilities in password-based login

## Lab: Username enumeration via different responses

 This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

- Candidate usernames
- Candidate passwords

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

The lab features the following login panel:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b597411-b722-4965-9593-5e6e5ea5e05e)

We attempted to log in with test credentials:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3129c73-ac3b-4142-b33d-63643ff746f6)

We perform fuzzing with `ffuf` using the `candidate_usernames.txt` wordlist provided by **PortSwigger**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3798bbce-e4ba-4fb3-a098-fa8b3db6f6d6)

Now that we have the username, we perform the login again with `cURL` to observe the behavior:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00faf889-916a-4195-9ee2-ac4f0a662914)

We make the request again with `ffuf`, now filtering "Incorrect password" using the `candidate_passwords.txt` wordlist:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a96bbf0-b102-4106-b4f7-26e2cd420ebc)

We log in and complete the lab:

## Lab: Username enumeration via subtly different responses

 This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

- Candidate usernames
- Candidate passwords

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page. 

We made the request using `cURL`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7cb48f-a367-4e11-99be-2af01de098ae)

We performed fuzzing with `ffuf`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92663fd5-71d1-47f1-b19e-ef859092eec7)

We see that the user is **vagrant**.  

As an alternative, we try fuzzing again but filtering with a regex that exactly matches that string. We created a bash script:  
```bash
#!/bin/bash

WORDLIST="candidate_usernames.txt"

URL="https://0a5d00730450e252d7fd8d9d006400f4.web-security-academy.net/login"

HEADERS="Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

while read -r USER; do
    RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$URL" \
        -H "$HEADERS" \
        -d "username=$USER&password=test")

    if [[ "$RESPONSE" != *"Invalid username or password."* ]]; then
        echo "Posible usuario v√°lido: $USER"
    fi
done < "$WORDLIST"
```


We run the script:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/361d0727-cd11-4583-8880-b7db34e9c7c4)

We could also have used BurpSuite's Intruder:  

First, we need to add the payload, include the wordlist, and in **settings** we need to configure the `GREP-EXTRACT` section:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a188d900-d951-4db7-9b24-40a3d29677ed)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da809777-e29d-41cb-be7c-6565cf0ae109)



Now that we have the **vagrant** user, we make a `cURL` request with a test password to observe the behavior:"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b0e5995-aa3e-468c-b4ac-eb0c075adaa0)
We see that a '.' is missing at the end of the sentence. Now, we perform password fuzzing and filter **Invalid username or password**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bae9716-68c4-4193-b2ff-fad2a13e83c7)

Now we log in with the credentials and solve the lab:

## Lab: Username enumeration via response timing

This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

- Your credentials: wiener:peter
Wordlists:
- Candidate usernames
- Candidate passwords

Hint: To add to the challenge, the lab also implements a form of IP-based brute-force protection. However, this can be easily bypassed by manipulating HTTP request headers.

We make the request with `cURL` to observe the response:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b0216ad-f410-43e4-8917-8c4f35f191d3)
After a few attempts, we get the message:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627286b2-98df-489e-a169-4204d6d6247f)

We send the request from Burp to the Intruder and configure a Pitchfork Attack, which performs parallel fuzzing with 2 payloads:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10a8ff49-fdae-48cc-ad68-3c91e49fa874)
We spoof the IP with the "X-Forwarded-For" header and fuzz the username. At the same time, in `Settings`, `Grep - Match`, we configure the negative filter for the response "Invalid username or password.":
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bceb7ad-ce4c-4885-95b0-1f4b191697f6)
We see that despite applying the filter, this time there is no visible difference:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25e1784d-c858-4ed1-9034-a8424f8a4c59)

We can see that if we manually test in the Repeater with our valid username, when the password is very large, the request takes much longer compared to when the login is successful.
We proceed to check the difference in the response timing by performing the same attack, sending a large password (100 characters) using intruder:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ebf0359-6729-4049-ab8d-2422d4bb6a8b)
We can see that the response with the username `amarillo` takes significantly longer than the other requests:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e64508d0-8ec5-4803-9dec-85bcbf1fca33)
We proceed to modify the payloads to perform a brute force attack with the passwords:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49bf4f60-2f68-4e3e-b0eb-8c50d49d0bc6)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da982241-62f1-435f-8730-f7587e3b29d6)

We proceed to log in and complete the lab:
