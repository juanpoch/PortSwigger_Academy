# Lab: Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities

This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.

Chat messages that you submit are viewed by a support agent in real time.

To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an `alert()` popup in the support agent's browser.
