# Lab: Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. 
Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. 
Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
