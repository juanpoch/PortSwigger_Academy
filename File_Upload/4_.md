# Lab: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass

This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function.
Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`.

Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

`Hint`: You need to upload two different files to solve this lab.
